## Bio

I am a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft, where I work on the Confidential Containers project, a CNCF sandbox initiative that aims to provide a secure and private way to run containerized workloads on Kubernetes. I have been involved in the Kubernetes space for over six years and has worked for Red Hat and [Kinvolk](https://twitter.com/kinvolkio) on various Kubernetes technologies such as OpenShift, service-meshes, Helm, Lokomotive, etc. I have also contributed to several Kubernetes upstream projects, including Kubernetes, Kubernetes docs, Contour, Podman, and Crio. I hold CKA and CKS certifications, and I was also an organizer of the Kubernetes Bangalore meetup group from 2017 to 2022. I have spoken at numerous conferences and events, such as Kubecon, Pycon India, DevOpsDays Bangalore, FOSDEM, Cloud Native Rejekts, and DevConf.

I am a bibliophile, tech enthusiast, open-source contributor, productivity geek, hiker, etc.
